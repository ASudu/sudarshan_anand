        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I am Sudarshan Anand. I am a first-year graduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), pursuing M.S. in Computational Science and Engineering.
          I currently work at <a href="https://www.rezolve.ai/" target="_blank">Rezolve.ai</a>, as an AI-Product Development Intern. I work on impactful Agentic AI-based solutions that transform IT Service management and HR Service Desk in Enterprises. Prior to this, I worked in AdityaLab, on Samay- an open-source python library for time-series foundational modelling.
          I am also part of the Responsible-AI for Decision Making (College of Computing, Georgia Tech) team where we work on applying AI responsibly to Healthcare and various engineering domains.
          I am intrigued by the applications of Mathematics in fields like Healthcare, Finance, and Crime Analytics. My fascination for the simple yet expressive structure of graphs led me to the field of Graph Machine Learning.  I recently worked as an AI Scientist Intern at <a href="https://www.qure.ai/us" target="_blank">Qure.ai</a>, focusing on Lung Cancer diagnosis with the help of AI.
          I like to teach the concepts I learn in very simple language using daily analogies.
          My hobbies include sketching, painting, writing poems, playing tennis, and listening to music.
